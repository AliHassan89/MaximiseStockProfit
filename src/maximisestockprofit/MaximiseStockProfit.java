/*

Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading Apple
stocks will. Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am 
local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient method that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best 
profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  int[] stockPricesYesterday = new int[] {10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};

getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
// returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the 
same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
